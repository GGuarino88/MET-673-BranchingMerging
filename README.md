BU MET CS 673 ASSIGNMENT: Branching and Merging

# PERSONAL INTRODUCTION
Having originally come from Italy, I made the significant decision to relocate to the United States in 2013, enabling me to embark on a new journey filled with fresh opportunities and cultural adaptation. Currently, I am nearing the completion of my Computer Science degree at Boston University, while also working as an International Sales Manager with 15 years of experience. Alongside my professional pursuits, I have nurtured my passion for music as a part-time musician. Presently, I am actively transitioning my career towards the field of Computer Science.
Since childhood, my interest in Computer Science has continuously fueled my eagerness to acquire new skills and delve into emerging technologies. 
My experience revolves mostly around backend, with proficiency in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, and SQL. 
In this project, I have assumed the role of Configuration Manager while also actively contributing to the Development Team.
